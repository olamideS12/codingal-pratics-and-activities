        <p>my name is haddiyat afeez am 14 years old i live in Nigerai my fav ourite colour is purple, black and white. The name of my school is blooombreed high school am a n ew student but sometimes i really miss my old classmates but the ones i have now are very fun and exciting. Sometimes I wonder if my mom is BRAIN DEAD. Then there are days
            when I know she is.
            Like today.
            The drama started this morning when I casually asked if she would buy me
            one of those cool new iPhones that do almost everything. I considered it a
            necessity of life, second only to maybe oxygen.
            What better way to clinch a spot in the CCP (Cute, Cool & Popular) group
            at my new private school, Westchester Country Day, than by dazzling them
            with a wicked new cell.
            Last year, it seemed like I was the ONLY student in my ENTIRE middle
            school who didn’t have one 
           supercheap on eBay.
            . 
           So I bought an older, used phone
            It was bigger than what I wanted, but I figured I couldn’t go wrong for the
            clearance price of only $12.99.
            I put my telephone in my locker and spread the word that everyone could
            now call me with all the JUICY gossip on my NEW telephone! Then I
            counted down the minutes before my social life started heating up.
            I got really nervous when two of the CCP girls came walking down the hall
            in my direction chatting on their cell phones.
           They came right over to my locker and started acting superfriendly. Then
            they invited me to sit with them at lunch and I was like, “Umm…okay.” But
            deep down inside I was jumping up and down and doing my Snoopy
            “happy dance.”
            Then things got really strange. They said they had heard about my new
            $600 Juicy Couture designer cell phone and that everyone (meaning the rest
            of the CCP crew) couldn’t wait to see it.
            I was about to explain that I had said “juicy gossip on my new phone” NOT
            “new gossip on my Juicy phone,” but I never got a chance because,
            unfortunately, my telephone starting ringing. Very abnormally loudly. I was
            trying my best to ignore it, but both of the CCP girls were staring at me
            like, “Well, aren’t you going to answer it?!They came right over to my locker and started acting superfriendly. Then
            they invited me to sit with them at lunch and I was like, “Umm…okay.” But
            deep down inside I was jumping up and down and doing my Snoopy
            “happy dance.”
            Then things got really strange. They said they had heard about my new
            $600 Juicy Couture designer cell phone and that everyone (meaning the rest
            of the CCP crew) couldn’t wait to see it.
            I was about to explain that I had said “juicy gossip on my new phone” NOT
            “new gossip on my Juicy phone,” but I never got a chance because,
            unfortunately, my telephone starting ringing. Very abnormally loudly. I was
            trying my best to ignore it, but both of the CCP girls were staring at me
            like, “Well, aren’t you going to answer it?!”
           Obviously, I didn’t want to answer it because I had a really bad feeling they
            were going to be a little disappointed when they actually saw my phone.
            So I just stood there praying that it would stop ringing, but it didn’t. And
            pretty soon, everyone in the hallway was staring at me too.
            Finally, I gave in, snatched open my locker, and answered the phone.
            Mainly to stop that AWFUL ringing.
            I was like, “Hello?
            Umm…sorry. Wrong number.”
            And when I turned around, both of the CCP girls were running down the
            hall screaming, “Make it go away! Make it go away!” I guessed it probably
            meant they DIDN’T want me to sit with them at lunch anymore, which
            really sucked.
            The most important lesson I learned last year was that having a CRUDDY
            phone—or NONE at all—can totally RUIN your social life. While hordes
            of celebrity party girls regularly FORGET to wear undies, not a single one
            would be caught dead without her cell phone. Which was why I was
            nagging my mom about buying me an iPhone.
            I’ve tried saving up my own money to buy one, but it was impossible to do.
            Mainly because I’m an artist and TOTALLY ADDICTED to drawing!
           Like, if I don’t do it every day, I’ll go NUTZ!
            I spend ALL of my cash on sketchbooks, pencils, pens, art camp, and other
            stuff. Hey, I’m so BROKE, I have a milkshake on layaway at McDonald’s!
            Anyway, when mom came home from the mall with a special back-to
           school present for me, I was pretty sure I knew what it was.
            She rambled on and on about how my attending a new private school was
            going to be a “stressful time of tremendous personal growth” and how my
            best “coping mechanism” would be to “communicate” my “thoughts and
            feelings.”
            I was absolutely
            ECSTATIC
            because you can communicate with a
            NEW CELL PHONE!
            Right?! 
           I kind of zoned out on most of what my mom was saying because I was
            DAYDREAMING about all of the cool ring tones, music, and movies I was
            going to download. It was going to be LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT!
           But after my mom finally finished her little speech, she smiled really big,
            hugged me, and handed me a BOOK.
            I opened it and FRANTICALLY flipped through the pages, figuring that
            maybe she had hidden my new cell phone inside.
            It made perfect sense at the time because all the advertisements said it was
            the thinnest model on the market.
            But slowly it dawned on me that my mom had NOT gotten me a cell phone,
            and my so-called present was just a stupid little book! 
           Talk about major HEARTBREAK!
            Then I noticed that ALL the pages of the book were BLANK.
            I was like, OH. NO. SHE. DIDN’T!
            My mom had given me two things: a DIARY and irrefutable evidence she
            IS, in fact,
            CLINICALLY BRAIN DEAD!</p>
